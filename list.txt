Installation:
1.Hello World
2.Search the web and find a way to take user's name as input in prompt and print hello user

Variables:
1.Use pi value as global variable in your program to print the area of circle
2.Use local variable take input from user and print the nearest prime power of 3.
3.Program using Constants

Datatypes:
1.Take input from user and print the type of data inputed
2.Take input a sequence of numbers from user and store it in a list or array
3.Initialize a hash or dictionary with five key->value sets and print the second the key->value pair

Type casting:
1.Take float as input from user and convert it into integer and string and print it in respective manner
2.Take a array of numbers and convert it into a string
3.Take a string and convert it into list or array by using the spaces in the string as delimiter

Control Structures:

if-else and elif:
1.Print whether a given number is odd and also a multiple of nine
2.Print the grade of person using the following conditions
  ->A if percentage >85
  ->A- if %<=85 and >80
  ->B if %<=80 and >70
  ->C if %<=70 and >60
  ->D if %<=60 and >40
  ->E if %<=40 and also should print 'candidate failed' if %<=35
3.Find maxima or minima of a given function
4.Should find whether the given year is leap year or not following the conditions
  The year can be evenly divided by 4, unless;
  The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless;
  The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
5.Find derivative and integral of polynomial

Loops:
1.In physics, contact between objects during a collision leads to loss of force as no medium is perfect.
likely we are having n medium in a plane each of equal length followed by qouitient of reduction, In can be well
explained using the following example
person throws a ball on plane from certain height h of n medium your job is to find distance traveled in plane
and the medium is repetted in cyclic order and height is only considered in integers
input:
  3(number of medium)
  4(length of each)
  5(height from which ball is thrown)
  2(distance travelled for each step)
  0.1
  0.3
  0.5
  output:
  first  step 5*0.9= 4 dist = 2
  second step 4*0.9= 3 dist = 4
  third  step 3*0.7= 2 dist = 6
  fouth  step 2*0.7= 1 dist = 8
  fifth  step 1*0.5= 0 dist = 10
  so,the result is 10(ten) steps
2.Using loops of your choice and print as follows for a given input
input:
3
9
output:
----a----
---bbb---
--ccccc--
---bbb---
----a----
3.Check whether a given number is in a goemetric progression or not for a given initial value and factor
4.Using loops make a game to play bulls and cows
5.Print the number pyramid of height n(input from user)
  for 3
  1
  11
  111

Datatype recap with loops:
1.Should find the percentage of a student for input given in following manner
3
student1 78 56 72
student2 83 67 78
student3 83 75 67
student3
output: 75
2.Should print  the name of student having second least percentage from the given list of students  if
there are multiple students should print multiple students in alphabetical order
5
rag 77
teja 89
bhavana 84
praveen 77
bhadram 75
output:
praveen
rag
3.Use array as set  in the program to store only unique items in a array or list

File Handling:
1.Open a text file and print all the data in it.
2.Open a text file and print the nth line in text file if nth line does not exist print 'no data'
3.Open a csv file and print only the second column in the file
4.Append two files

Functions:
1. Write a function to find gcd of two numbers
2. Write a function to find whether a given number is armstrong number or not
3. Write a number to generate sequence of primes that are exactly at absoute difference of 1 with powers of two.
4. Write a function to find the voting result based on a string input such that a letter
in string belongs to a particular party
5. Factorial of a number.

Regular Expressions:
1.Extract the mail addresses in the given string using regular expression
2.Find the sum of the numbers in a string 1A2wq1acef31sdac4
3.Replace all the patterns like '[!*]' without using loops
4.Find the total occurences of a symbol in string using reqular expressions

OOPS:
1.Build a class to store the data of the mobile phones with screen size,ram,company and processor along with Constructor and function to estimate cost of phone based on conditions
  samsung:7000(pr)
  moto:5999
  lenovo:4000
  nokia:6100
  est cost = pr*(scr size/4.0)+pr*(ram/1.0)+pr*(proc/1.0)+0.05*pr
