#### Functions:

PHP functions are similar to other programming languages. A function is a piece of code which takes one more input in the form of parameter and does some processing and returns a value.

You already have seen many functions like fopen() and fread() etc. They are built-in functions but PHP gives you option to create your own functions as well and you just need to call them according to your requirement.

#### Example Programs:

1. Write a function to find gcd of two numbers
2. Write a function to find whether a given number is armstrong number or not
3. Write a number to generate sequence of primes that are exactly at absoute difference of 1 with powers of two.
4. Write a function to find the voting result based on a string input such that a letter
in string belongs to a particular party
5. Factorial of a number.
