#### 12. Object-Oriented:

  * Class − This is a programmer-defined data type, which includes local functions as well as local data. You can think of a class as a template for making many instances of the same kind (or class) of object.
  * Object − An individual instance of the data structure defined by a class. You define a class once and then make many objects that belong to it. Objects are also known as instance.
  * Inheritance − When a class is defined by inheriting existing function of a parent class then it is called inheritance. Here child class will inherit all or few member functions and variables of a parent class.
  * Polymorphism − This is an object oriented concept where same function can be used for different purposes. For example function name will remain same but it make take different number of arguments and can do different task.
  * Overloading − a type of polymorphism in which some or all of operators have different implementations depending on the types of their arguments. Similarly functions can also be overloaded with different implementation.
  * Data Abstraction − Any representation of data in which the implementation details are hidden (abstracted).
  * Encapsulation − refers to a concept where we encapsulate all the data and member functions together to form an object.
  * Constructor − refers to a special type of function which will be called automatically whenever there is an object formation from a class.
  * Destructor − refers to a special type of function which will be called automatically whenever an object is deleted or goes out of scope.

#### Example programs:

1. Build a class to store the data of the mobile phones with screen size,ram,company and processor along with Constructor and function to estimate cost of phone based on conditions

  samsung:7000(pr)

  moto:5999

  lenovo:4000

  nokia:6100

  est cost = pr*(scr size/4.0)+pr*(ram/1.0)+pr*(proc/1.0)+0.05*pr

2. Use the mobile phone class as parent and build the accessory class for a shop for biling purpose.
3. Use Function Overriding and polymorphism in a class
4. Implement a substitution cipher in a class using regular expressions by inhereting ciphers from a parent class function
