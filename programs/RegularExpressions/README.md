#### Regular Expressions:

1. POSIX Regular Expressions

The structure of a POSIX regular expression is not dissimilar to that of a typical arithmetic expression: various elements (operators) are combined to form more complex expressions.
The simplest regular expression is one that matches a single character, such as g, inside strings such as g, haggle, or bag.

2. PERL Style Regular Expressions

Perl-style regular expressions are similar to their POSIX counterparts. The POSIX syntax can be used almost interchangeably with the Perl-style regular expression functions. In fact, you can use any of the quantifiers introduced in the previous POSIX section.

#### Exmaple programs:

1. Extract the mail addresses in the given string using regular expression
2. Find the sum of the numbers in a string 1A2wq1acef31sdac4
3. Replace all the patterns like '[!*]' without using loops
4. Find the total occurences of a symbol in string using reqular expressions
