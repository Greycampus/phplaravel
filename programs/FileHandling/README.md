#### File Handling:

PHP has several functions for creating, reading, uploading, and editing files.
  * The readfile() function reads a file and writes it to the output buffer.
  * The fopen() function open files. This function gives more options than the readfile() function.
  * The fread() function reads from an open file.
  * The fclose() function is used to close an open file.
  * The fgets() function is used to read a single line from a file.
  * The feof() function checks if the "end-of-file" (EOF) has been reached.

#### Example Programs:

1. Open a text file and print all the data in it.
2. Open a text file and print the nth line in text file if nth line does not exist print 'no data'
3. Open a csv file and print only the second column in the file
4. Append two files
