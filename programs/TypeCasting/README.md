#### Typecasting:

Type casting in PHP works much as it does in C: the name of the desired type is written in parentheses before the variable which is to be cast.
The casts allowed are:
  * (int), (integer) - cast to integer
  * (bool), (boolean) - cast to boolean
  * (float), (double), (real) - cast to float
  * (string) - cast to string
  * (array) - cast to array
  * (object) - cast to object
  * (unset) - cast to NULL (PHP 5)

#### Example programs:

1. Take float as input from user and convert it into integer and string and print it in respective manner
2. Take a array of numbers and convert it into a string
3. Take a string and convert it into list or array by using the spaces in the string as delimiter
