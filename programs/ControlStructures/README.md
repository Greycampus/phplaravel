#### Control structures:

#### 1. Decision making:

You can use conditional statements in your code to make your decisions. PHP supports following three decision making statements.
- if else statement − use this statement if you want to execute a set of code when a condition is true and another if the condition is not true
- elseif statement − is used with the if...else statement to execute a set of code if one of the several condition is true
- switch statement − is used if you want to select one of many blocks of code to be executed, use the Switch statement. The switch statement is used to avoid long blocks of if..elseif..else code.

 
#### 2. Loops

Often when you write code, you want the same block of code to run over and over again in a row. Instead of adding several almost equal code-lines in a script, we can use loops to perform a task like this.
In PHP, we have the following looping statements:
 - while - loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.
 - do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true.
 - for - loops through a block of code a specified number of times .
 - foreach - loops through a block of code for each element in an array .

#### Example Programs:
- Decision Making:

 1. Print whether a given number is odd and also a multiple of nine
 2. Print the grade of person using the following conditions

    ->A if percentage >85

    ->A- if %<=85 and >80

    ->B if %<=80 and >70

    ->C if %<=70 and >60

    ->D if %<=60 and >40

    ->E if %<=40 and also should print 'candidate failed' if %<=35

 3. Find maxima or minima of a given function
 4. Should find whether the given year is leap year or not following the conditions

    The year can be evenly divided by 4, unless;

    The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless;

    The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

 5. Find derivative and integral of polynomial

- Loops
 
 1. In physics, contact between objects during a collision leads to loss of force as no medium is perfect. Likely we are having n medium in a plane each of equal length followed by qouitient of reduction, In can be well explained using the following example

A person throws a ball on plane from certain height h of n medium your job is to find distance traveled in plane and the medium is repetted in cyclic order and height is only considered in integers

input:

  3(number of medium)

  4(length of each)

  5(height from which ball is thrown)

  2(distance travelled for each step)

  0.1

  0.3

  0.5

  output:

  first  step 5*0.9= 4 dist = 2

  second step 4*0.9= 3 dist = 4

  third  step 3*0.7= 2 dist = 6

  fouth  step 2*0.7= 1 dist = 8

  fifth  step 1*0.5= 0 dist = 10

  so,the result is 10(ten) steps

2. Using loops of your choice and print as follows for a given input

input:

3

9

output:

----a----

---bbb---

--ccccc--

---bbb---

----a----

3. Check whether a given number is in a goemetric progression or not for a given initial value and factor
4. Using loops make a game to play bulls and cows
5. Print the number pyramid of height n(input from user) using a single variable in entire program for 3
